As it said that we tried to test our system in real environment and we found mixed reviews.
Testing prototype in real environment means provide our base website to the people for
which it has been developed and also take feedback after using the system. According to the
feedback of some users some functionalities such as feedback to professional, payment
method , simple interface , provide good services etc, Which are requested by user. Then we decided to include
all these required features in our website.
Thus, we will provide a website that satisfies all needs of our users to complete our website.
